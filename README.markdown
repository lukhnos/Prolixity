Prolixity
=========

Prolixity is my personal project to design a programming language for iOS devices. Even at an early stage, the language is mostly complete and can be used for small programs.

The syntax of the language is designed to be usable on a touch-screen keyboard: It requires few special symbols, and auto-correcting spell checkers on mobile devices will be friendly with its keywords and identifiers. The runtime system directly piggybacks on the Objective-C runtime, and therefore can access any exposed Objective-C API.

With the design goals, the language will be useful for quick scripting on mobile devices. It can also be used as an embedded scripting language for your own app, so that you can enable user scripting or allow a "dev mode" for easier debugging.


Building the Demo App
---------------------

Please clone this project and run the app on either the iOS Simulator or your iPad. I have supplied a few example snippets that should give a good overview of this language and the design goals.


Note on Building From A Fresh Clone
-----------------------------------

	$ cd parser
	$ make
	$ cd ..


Note on Building with Xcode 3.2.5
---------------------------------

The previous version of Prolixity can be built with Xcode 3.2.5. However,
since Xcode 4 has become official, Xcode 3.2.5 support is now discontinued.
